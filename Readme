My project reads in a chossen prefix from a user which the runs my bruteforce auto complete method.
This method scans through the 10,000 list of words in an arraylist and once its found all the options it can with the given prefix,
it asks how many would the user like to see.
it then returns its requested number of answers to the user in the console
